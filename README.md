Design idea by [Cindy Shin in Behance](https://www.behance.net/adagio07)


The .h1-title div for the index page has a very different height and vertical spacing than that same area in the original design. Remember to add some padding or setting a minimum height. 
- There is no side margins for the body of the page in the original design, but yours have extra margins/passings in the mobile version. 
- Check the original design here again (https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) 
- In the mobile version the navbar should collapse to an hamburger menu. Your nav bar remains on small screens. 
- Work more on the responsiveness of the site while still following the original design. 
- The tickets page is not responsive for mobile screens, at least on Firefox. - The tickets page design is not close enough to the original one, try to add similar borders to the ticket table.
